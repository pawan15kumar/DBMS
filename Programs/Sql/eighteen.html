        Grouping the retrieved values
        In MySQL, the GROUP BY clause is used in conjunction with aggregate functions to group rows that have the same values into summary rows. It's commonly used to perform aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, or MIN on groups of data. Here's the basic syntax:
        
        Syntax
        SELECT column1, aggregate_function(column2) FROM table_name GROUP BY column1;
        
        Additionally, you can use the HAVING clause to filter groups based on aggregate conditions. The HAVING clause is similar to the WHERE clause but is applied after the GROUP BY operation.
        
        SELECT column1, aggregate_function(column2) FROM table_name GROUP BY column1 HAVING condition;
        
        Example Table : student
        RollNo	Name	PhoneNo	Class	Marks	City
        4201	Abhishek	9688258565	BCA-I	296	Chandigarh
        4202	Anjali	7812569871	BCA-I	246	Punjab
        4203	Aman	7639927794	BCA-I	286	Punjab
        4204	Asha	6259927794	BCA-I	156	Haryana
        Query
        SELECT City, count(*) as No_of_students FROM student GROUP BY City;
        City	No_of_students
        Chandigarh	1
        Punjab	2
        Haryana	1
        SELECT City, count(*) as No_of_students FROM student GROUP BY City Having count(city) < 2;
        City	No_of_students
        Chandigarh	1
        Haryana	1
