        Self Join
        A self-join is a type of join in SQL where a table is joined with itself. This is useful when you want to compare rows within the same table based on some condition. There are different types of self-joins, depending on the criteria used for comparison:
        
        Syntax
        SELECT columns FROM columns FROM table_name t1 JOIN table_name t2 ON t1.common_column = t2.common_column;;

        customerID	CustomerName	ContactNo	Country

        Query
        SELECT A.CustomerName AS CustomerName1, B.CustomerName AS CustomerName2 FROM Customers A, Customers B WHERE A.CustomerID <> B.CustomerID;
