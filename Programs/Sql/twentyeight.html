        Cartesian Join
        A Cartesian join, also known as a Cartesian product or cross join, is a join operation that returns the Cartesian product of the sets of rows from the joined tables. It means that it produces a result set in which each row from the first table is combined with every row from the second table. This type of join is less common and can result in a large result set, especially when joining tables with a large number of rows. There is essentially only one type of Cartesian join, but it can be performed using different syntax variations:
        
        Syntax
        SELECT columns FROM table1 CROSS JOIN table2;
        
        Example Table : Customers
        customerID	CustomerName	ContactNo	Country
        1	Abhishek	6283659862	Germany
        2	Anjali	7812569871	Mexico
        3	Aman	7639927794	Mexico
        Example Table : Orders
        OrderID	customerId	OrderDate
        10308	2	1996-09-18
        10309	37	1996-09-19
        10310	77	1996-09-20
        Query
        SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID FROM Customers CROSS JOIN Orders;
        CustomerName	OrderID
        Aman	10308
        Anjali	10308
        Abhishek	10308
        Aman	10309
        Anjali	10309
        Abhishek	10309
        Aman	10310
        Anjali	10310
        Abhishek	10310
