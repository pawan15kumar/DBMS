        Revoking Permissions from users
        In MySQL, the REVOKE statement is used to revoke previously granted privileges from users or roles. It effectively removes specific privileges from a user, limiting their access to certain databases, tables, or columns. Here's the basic syntax:
        
        Syntax
        REVOKE privileges ON database_name.table_name FROM 'user'@'host';
        
        Replace privileges with the specific privileges you want to revoke, database_name.table_name with the name of the database and table (or * for all tables) you want to revoke access from, and 'user'@'host' with the username and host for the user you want to revoke access from.
        
        Examples
        1. Example to revoke SELECT privileges on all tables in the school database to a user named 'john' from localhost:
        
        REVOKE SELECT ON school.* TO 'john'@'localhost';
        
        2. Example to revoke multiple privileges at once:
        
        REVOKE SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON school.* TO 'john'@'localhost';
        
        3. Example to revoke all privileges on all tables in the school database to a user named 'john' from localhost:
        
        REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON school.* TO 'john'@'localhost';
        
        4. Example to revoke all privileges on all databases to a user named 'john' from localhost:
        
        REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'john'@'localhost';
