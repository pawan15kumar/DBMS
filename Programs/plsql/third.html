        Variables in PL/SQL
        In PL/SQL, variables are used to store and manipulate data within a program. They can hold various types of data, such as numbers, characters, dates, and more. Here's how you declare and use variables in PL/SQL:
        
        Syntax for Variable Declaration :
        variable_name datatype [NOT NULL := initial_value];
        
        Variable Scope :
        Variables declared in the declaration section are visible within the block where they are declared.
        
        They can be referenced in subsequent PL/SQL statements within the same block.
        
        Initializing Variables :
        Variables can be initialized with an optional default value using the := assignment operator.
        
        If a variable is not initialized, it contains a NULL value by default.
        
        Syntax for Variable initialization :
        variable_name := value;
        
        Example :
        DECLARE
            num1 NUMBER := 10;
            str1 VARCHAR2(50) := 'Hello, world!';
        BEGIN
        END;
