        Datatypes in PL/SQL
        PL/SQL supports various data types that enable developers to work with different kinds of data efficiently. These data types can be categorized into several groups, including scalar data types, composite data types. Here's an overview of some commonly used PL/SQL data types:
        
        Data Type	Description
        Scalar Data Types
        CHAR/NCHAR	Fixed-length character data types, CHAR being space-padded and NCHAR being in Unicode.
        VARCHAR2/NVARCHAR2	Variable-length character data types, with VARCHAR2 being space-efficient and NVARCHAR2 being in Unicode.
        NUMBER	Numeric data type for storing fixed-point or floating-point numbers.
        DATE	Stores date and time information.
        BOOLEAN	Represents Boolean values TRUE, FALSE, and NULL.
        BINARY_INTEGER/PLS_INTEGER	Integer data types for storing whole numbers.
        FLOAT/REAL	Floating-point number data types.
        RAW	Stores binary data.
        ROWID	Stores the unique address of a row in the database table.
        LONG/RAW	Deprecated large object data types.
        Composite Data Types
        RECORD	A composite data type that can hold multiple fields of different data types.
        TABLE	A collection data type that can hold multiple values of the same data type.
        VARRAY	Variable-size array data type.
