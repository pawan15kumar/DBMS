        Cursors in PL/SQL
In the context of databases and SQL, a cursor is a database object used to retrieve and manipulate data from a result set returned by a SQL query. Cursors provide a way to iterate over the rows of a result set one at a time, enabling programmatic control over data retrieval and manipulation. Here's an explanation of cursors:

There are two types of Cursors:
1) Implicit Cursors 2) Explicit Cursors

Attributes of cursors
Attribute	Description
%FOUND	Returns TRUE if a fetch operation successfully retrieves a row.
%NOTFOUND	Returns TRUE if a fetch operation fails to retrieve a row.
%ROWCOUNT	Returns the number of rows fetched so far.
%ISOPEN	Returns TRUE if the cursor is open, FALSE if closed.

Basic Functionality :
Initialization : Cursors are initialized with a SQL query that defines the result set to be processed.

Execution : After initialization, the cursor is executed, and the query is executed against the database to fetch the result set.

Iteration : Cursors allow the program to fetch rows from the result set one at a time. The cursor keeps track of the current position within the result set.

Processing : Each fetched row can be processed individually within the program. This includes reading the values of columns, performing calculations, and executing further logic based on the row's data.

Termination : Cursors are typically closed once all rows in the result set have been processed. Closing the cursor releases associated resources and frees up database server memory.

Cursor Operations :
Opening : The cursor is opened to execute the associated SQL query and fetch the result set.

Fetching : Rows from the result set are retrieved one by one using the FETCH statement. Each fetch operation advances the cursor to the next row.

Closing : Once all rows have been processed, or when no longer needed, the cursor is closed using the CLOSE statement. This releases database resources associated with the cursor.
